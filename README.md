# 🧠 Retail Sales Analytics – End-to-End EDA Project
## 📌 Overview

Performed in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing on multi-source retail datasets including POS, marketing, search, and promotional data.

Built a consolidated weekly SKU-level analytical dataset for business insights and future ML modeling.

### 🎯 Business Objective

    - Analyze sales performance at SKU level

    - Measure impact of promotions & marketing

    - Align multi-source data (daily + weekly granularity)

    - Prepare clean dataset for forecasting / modeling

### 🔍 Key Work Done

    - Cleaned and analyzed 2 years of POS data (297 SKUs)
    
    - Handled 10K+ missing values and removed redundant features
    
    - Converted daily product data to weekly level
    
    - Aggregated ratings, search trends, and campaign data
    
    - Merged 6 datasets using SKU_ID and Date
    
    - Identified inconsistent marketing coverage across SKUs
    
    - Engineered time-based features

### 📊 Key Insights

    - Not all SKUs participate in promotions

    - Ratings show a non-decreasing trend

    - Marketing coverage varies significantly

    - Granularity mismatch required transformation

    - Real-world data contained structured missingness

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn | VS Studio

### 🚀 Next Steps

    - Sales forecasting

    - Uplift modeling

    - Marketing attribution

    - Demand prediction
